        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="about-text">
            <p>I am a digital media specialist with more than ten years of media experience. 

                    I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Pretoria and Stellenbosch University. Between 2008 and 2009 I worked in news media as a junior journalist and tech reporter. I then did my masters at Indiana University.
                    
                    I returned to South Africa in 2012 and since then I have worked in the agency space and as a digital strategist and data journalist with the likes of Trigger Isobar, Code for South Africa and the South African Broadcasting Corporation.
                    
                    Currently I am the program officer at the South Africa Media Innovation Program and one of the executive committee members of Hacks/Hackers Johannesburg. 
                    
                    I am fascinated by the evolution of media from the way we consume content to how we interact on social media. I am also an aspiring data analyst with numerous certifications and projects.</p>
